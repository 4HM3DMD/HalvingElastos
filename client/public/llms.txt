# Elastos Halving Countdown
> Live countdown tracker for the Elastos (ELA) cryptocurrency halving event

## About This Site
This is the official Elastos halving countdown page operated by Elastos DAO. It displays real-time blockchain data showing the countdown to the next ELA block reward halving.

## Key Facts

### What is Elastos Halving?
Elastos halving is a pre-programmed event that reduces the ELA block reward by 50% every 1,051,200 blocks (approximately 4 years). This is a disinflationary mechanism similar to Bitcoin's halving, reducing the rate of new token creation over time.

### Current Halving Status
- Current halving era: 2nd (after 1st halving in December 2021)
- Next halving: 2nd halving at block 2,102,400
- Estimated date: December 2025
- Current block reward: 1.522 ELA per block
- After halving reward: 0.761 ELA per block

### ELA Tokenomics
- Maximum supply: 28,219,999 ELA (hard cap)
- Circulating supply: ~26 million ELA (over 92% issued)
- Burned tokens: 13 million ELA (July 30, 2020)
- Halving interval: 1,051,200 blocks (~4 years)
- Block time: ~2 minutes average

### Reward Distribution
Block rewards are distributed as follows:
- 35% to Bitcoin miners (via merged mining/AuxPoW)
- 35% to BPoS Validators
- 30% to DAO Treasury

### Network Security
Elastos uses a hybrid consensus mechanism:
- AuxPoW (Auxiliary Proof of Work) - Merged mining with Bitcoin
- BPoS (Bonded Proof of Stake) - Validator staking
- PoI (Proof of Integrity) - Node verification

This gives Elastos access to Bitcoin's hashpower for security while maintaining its own validator network.

### Halving Schedule
| Halving | Block Height | Est. Date | Block Reward |
|---------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1st | 1,051,200 | Dec 2021 | 1.522 ELA |
| 2nd | 2,102,400 | Dec 2025 | 0.761 ELA |
| 3rd | 3,153,600 | ~Dec 2029 | 0.3805 ELA |
| 4th | 4,204,800 | ~Dec 2033 | 0.1903 ELA |
| 5th | 5,256,000 | ~Dec 2037 | 0.0951 ELA |
| 6th | 6,307,200 | ~Dec 2041 | 0.0476 ELA |

Mining continues until approximately 2105 when maximum supply is reached.
